I have uploaded my codes that were used for several of my bioinformatics projects. 
If there is anyone who would like to use my code, please feel free to use it. 
The code descriptions are as below (file path #description):


R/biomaRt.R #gene name mapping
R/DEG_visualization.R #visualization for DEGs from DEA (i.e heatmap, volcano plot) 
R/maftools.R #summarizing, analyzing and visualizing MAF files
